# **Evaluating Evidence Lesson Plan \- Level 1**

## COR Question: What is the evidence? 

| The Problem: When evidence is convincingly stated or aligns with our beliefs, it can be tempting to accept it without stopping to ask whether the evidence comes from a reliable source or directly supports the claims being made.   | This lesson gives students a chance to practice evaluating evidence based on its reliability and its relation to the claim being made. Students work in groups to evaluate several examples of online evidence and engage in class discussions about the strength of the evidence. |

**Please note:** There are two versions of this lesson. The Level 2 version contains more advanced content. 

## **Materials:** 

* Computers for students  
* Lesson slides  
* Hyperlinks to examples of evidence for group practice   
  * Note: Some school networks may block social media sites like YouTube and Twitter, and students need to access these sites to view examples in this lesson. Determine whether students are able to access these sites on school computers beforehand.   
* Graphic organizer for students (hyperlink or hard copies)  
* Copies of “[Comments Section](https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/assessments/comments-section/)” for formative assessment

## **Lesson Plan:**

1. Introduction to “What’s the evidence?”   
   1. Note:  If you taught the “[Intro to What’s the Evidence?](https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/lessons/intro-to-whats-the-evidence/)” lesson, you’ve already introduced students to questioning the reliability and relevance of evidence and students evaluated the evidence in the “Evaluating Evidence” task. You may wish to streamline the section below and use it to quickly review the most important questions to ask of evidence.    
   1. Project “[Evaluating Evidence](https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/assessments/evaluating-evidence/)” task (see https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/assessments/evaluating-evidence/)  
      1. Note: In order to engage with this post, students need to be familiar with the following terms and topics. Based on your students’ background knowledge, you may want to review these before asking students to evaluate the post.  
         1. A large earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in 2011\.  
         2. A plant that produced nuclear energy, the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant, was damaged by these natural disasters. Some nuclear radiation, which can be very harmful to living things, leaked from the plant.   
      2. Ask students to write down their answers to the question that accompanies the Imgur post: Does this post provide strong evidence about conditions near the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant?  
      3. As a class, discuss their answers. Consider the following about the evidence presented:   
         1. We don’t know anything about the person who posted the photo. We have a username but no additional information about who they are. Because we don’t know their name, there is no way to search for more information about them.   
         2. This photo is posted on Imgur, a site where anyone can upload photos.   
         3. We don’t know where this photograph was taken. The caption implies that it is near the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant, but there is no concrete evidence about where the photo was taken.   
         4. We don’t know that radiation from the power plant caused the daisies to look this way. The daisies’ appearance could have been caused by something else.  
      4. Summarize the questions to consider when you analyze evidence. (These questions are summarized on Slide 1 of the lesson slides.)  
         1. What is the source of the evidence? Is that source trustworthy? Explain to students: *These questions deal with whether the evidence is **reliable**—whether we can trust it to present accurate, truthful information.*   
         2. Does the evidence directly relate to and support the claim being made? Explain to students: *These questions deal with whether the evidence is **related** to the claim.*  
         3. *When we analyze evidence, we need to pay attention to **both** whether it is **reliable** and whether it is **related** to the claim.*

2. Evaluating Evidence: Group Practice  
   1. Pass out the graphic organizer and explain to students that they are going to work in groups to practice analyzing online evidence.  
   2. For each source, consider: Is this strong evidence for the claim? Tell students to use the graphic organizer to guide their analysis of the evidence.   
      1. Note: The first row of the graphic organizer is filled out, using the daisies example from the beginning of class, to provide an example to students of how to use the graphic organizer. You could delete this row if you don’t think students will need it or if you want to fill it out together as a class.   
   3. Examples:  
      1. Eric Trump meme on Slide 2 of lesson slides (project so groups can discuss and analyze it)  
      2. Air Quality Tweet: [https://twitter.com/nbcbayarea/status/1063582585987710976](https://twitter.com/nbcbayarea/status/1063582585987710976)

3. Class discussion:   
   1. Have groups share their conclusions about the evidence and discuss as a class.   
   2. As groups share, encourage them to be explicit in their analysis of the evidence presented. Is their analysis based on whether the evidence is **reliable**? Whether it is **related** to the claim? Both?   
   3. Specific points to raise about each source:   
      1. Eric Trump meme:   
         1. Is it reliable? The meme itself was posted on social media by an unknown user, so we don’t know anything about how reliable they are. It claims that Eric Trump made the statement on Fox News in November 2018\. These specific details might make it more tempting to accept as true; however, there is no link or further proof provided that these details are actually true or that Eric Trump ever said these words.  
         2. Is it related to the claim? If we could confirm that Eric Trump actually said this, it might support a claim that Eric Trump thinks his father should have much more power as president. However, there is absolutely no proof that Eric Trump ever said these words—anyone could simply type words next to his photo. It is not relevant evidence for the claim.   
      2. Air quality tweet:    
         1. Is it reliable? This tweet is from @NBCBayArea, which is the Twitter account of the NBC-affiliated local news station in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is likely to be a generally reliable source. Additionally, the evidence from the claim is a timeline of satellite images of the Bay Area provided by NASA, also likely to be a reliable source.    
         2. Is it related to the claim? The timelapse video, which is embedded in the tweet, shows smoke over the Bay Area. Although the amount of smoke changes from day to day and some days appear clearer than others, it does not get increasingly less smokey over time. Thus, the video is relevant evidence for the claim that, as of the day the tweet was published, the air quality had not improved.   
      3. Pig Photo: 

      Note: After this lesson plan was written, the Instagram account was renamed from Diply Facts to The Lowdown. If students research this account, they may want to use 'Diply' in their search.

         1. Is it reliable? This tweet is from @thelowdownofficial, an Instagram account run by a group called Diply Facts. The information might be tempting to accept because it is so specific, but since we don’t know whether the account is reliable, we shouldn’t trust these facts without doing more research. If you do research this account, you will learn that it is associated with the social news and media website Diply, which focuses on creating viral content to sell advertisements. Some of their posts may contain factual information, but they prioritize virality over accuracy and generally do not provide the sources of the information they post. This is not a reliable post of information about pig behavior.  
         2. Is it related to the claim? There is no actual evidence provided to support any of the claims in this post. The photograph of pigs does not add any proof, and there is no indication of the source of the information.

4. Formative assessment:  
   1. Ask students to work independently to complete “[Comments Section](https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/assessments/comments-section/)” task  
      1. Rubric and sample student response are available here: [https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/assessments/comments-section/](https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/assessments/comments-section/)  
      2. This assessment shows students a comment posted by “Joe Smith” and asks students whether they would use Joe Smith’s information in a research paper about the U.S. healthcare system.   
   2. In order to successfully complete the task, students need to raise relevant critiques of the evidence Joe Smith presents: We do not know anything about Joe Smith’s background or whether he is a reliable source of information on the U.S. healthcare system. Further, he provides no source for the statistics he provides. Student responses to this task will help you assess students’ ability to analyze evidence.
