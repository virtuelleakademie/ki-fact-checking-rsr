| Example: Nuclear Daisies |  Source: An imgur user called “pleasegoogleShakerAamerpleasegoogleDavidKelly” Claim: The daisies are growing in an unusual way because of radiation from the nuclear power plant disaster in Japan. | We don’t know anything about this imgur user, so we don’t know anything about their reliability. | The photo shows some daisies growing in an unusual way. | There is no source provided for who actually took this picture, so we don’t know where it was taken. | The source claims that the daisies’ unusual growth was caused by nuclear radiation, but there is no proof of that in this picture. Many things could have caused the daisies to grow that way. | Because of questions about where the evidence came from and the limits in what it shows, the picture is not strong evidence. |
